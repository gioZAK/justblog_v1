## UX

The blog objective is to be accessible to everyone, anyone can create an account and post there, there is no fixed topic, any content is accepted.
Only the comments require aprove so insults can be avoided.

### Site User Goal

- Read new content posted by someone.
- Read other user comments related to a post.
- Post and Comment in the website to express himself.

### Site Goal

- Provide a platform where people can express themselves.
- Moderate unwanted comments or if needed delete a post.
- Provide entertainment.

## Agile Workflow

This project was created using Agile techniques during development, such as:

- User stories: displayed using GitHub Issues.
- MoSCoW method: by adding a priority to each issue and display it using tags.
- ToDo, In Progress and Done: using the GitHub Kanban board.

You can access the Kanban board that was used during the project development [here](https://github.com/users/gioZAK/projects/10/views/1).
